# Operators and Expressions

## Mathematical Operators:
- **Arithmetic:**
  - Addition: `+`
  - Subtraction: `-`
  - Multiplication: `*`
  - Division: `/`
  - Modulus: `%`

## Relational Operators:
- `==`: Equal
- `!=`: Not equal
- `>`: Greater than
- `<`: Less than
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to
- `<=`: Less than or equal to
----------------//----------------
### Comparison
- `=` is assignment
- `=` is value comparison
- `===` is value and type comparison
- `!==` is not equal

## Logical Operators:
- `&&`: Logical AND
- `||`: Logical OR
- `!`: Logical NOT

## Assignment Operators:
- `=`: Assignment
- `+=`: Addition and assignment
- `-=`: Subtraction and assignment
- `*=`: Multiplication and assignment
- `/=`: Division and assignment
- `%=`: Modulus and assignment

## Increment and Decrement Operators:
- `++`: Increment
- `--`: Decrement

## Order of Precedence:
1. Parentheses `( )`
2. Increment `++`, Decrement `--`
3. Multiplication `*`, Division `/`, Modulus `%`
4. Addition `+`, Subtraction `-`
5. Relational operators (equality, inequality, greater than, less than, etc.)
6. Logical AND `&&`
7. Logical OR `||`
8. Logical NOT `!`
9. Assignment `=`, `+=`, `-=` and so on.
