## Simple Storage: Variables
- **Variables:** Symbols that represent and store a single value in a program. This value can be modified or reassigned over time.

## Inline Storage: Arrays
- **Arrays:** Data structures that store an ordered collection of values of the same type. Each value is accessed through a numeric index representing its position in the array.

## Two-Dimensional Storage: Matrices
- **Matrices:** Rectangular arrangements of values, organized into rows and columns. Each element in a matrix is identified by a pair of indices, one for the row and another for the column.
